## Overview
Madeline is an alice-layout QAZ-style board with support for an encoder on either of the two `B` positions. The primary design feature is the wavy "undercut" pattern around the sides or back.

## Layout

Inspired by the QAZ, the layout features modifier-sized keys for the leftmost and rightmost columns. A KLE for Madeline is available [here]().

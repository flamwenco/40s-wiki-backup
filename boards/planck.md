# Planck

Planck is a unibody ortho keyboard designed by OLKB and sold by Drop.

### Overview
The Planck is a 4u x 12u ortho keyboard designed by OLKB. One of the notable facts about the keyboard is that the designer of the keyboard unintentionally used switch spacing of 19.00mm rather than the standard of 19.05mm, resulting in slightly less space between each key an potential, but unlikely keycap interference issues. The keyboard is after physicist Max Planck (citation needed). A version of the Planck called Preonic, with an additional row on the top for numbers, is also available.

### Layout

The most common layout used by Planck is the [MIT layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/##@@_a:7%3B&=Tab&=Q&=W&=E&=R&=T&=Y&=U&=I&=O&=P&=Back%20Space%3B&@=Esc&=A&=S&=D&=F&=G&=H&=J&=K&=L&=%2F%3B&='%3B&@=Shift&=Z&=X&=C&=V&=B&=N&=M&=,&=.&=%2F%2F&=Return%3B&@=&=Ctrl&=Alt&=Super&=%2F&dArr%2F%3B&_w:2%3B&=&=%2F&uArr%2F%3B&=%2F&larr%2F%3B&=%2F&darr%2F%3B&=%2F&uarr%2F%3B&=%2F&rarr%2F). The alternate is a full 1u grid layout.

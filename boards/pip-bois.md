# Pip Bois PCBs



The Pip Bois series of PCBs are several PCBs created by calvin-mcd and jlw_ and sold by jlw_ designed to fit within [Vault 35](/boards/vault-35) cases made by Mechvault. The rational behind these PCBs was to provide additional layout possibilities to those who enjoyed using Vault 35s but wanted to try out a different layout or whos prefered stagger was not traditional row stagger.

## Variants


### Availability

Vault35 kits are listed on Cain's site, https://mechvault.net/, when available. Vault35 kits or PCBs may also be found in the 40% Keyboard Discord server's buy-sell-trade forum or on Reddit's mechmarket. 

### Layout

Both variants of the Vault35 designed by cain support mutiple bottom rows, but have the same top 3 rows. In contrast to more standard "40s" the Vault35 uses a 1.75u enter, which is generally not included in 3-key 40s compatbility kits.

Cain, while not the progenitor of them, did popularize a bottom row layout known as "Cain Bars", which consists of a series of keycaps in size order of 1.25u, 1.75u, 1.75u, 1.25u. Cain bars are *not* exclusive to Vault35 keyboards

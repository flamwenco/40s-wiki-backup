# Vault 35

A Vault 35 is a 35% percent keyboard created and sold by Cain of MechVault

The hallmark of a Vault 35 is its 4u x 11u layout, small bezels, large blockers, and (usually) translucent case. The most popular variant of the Vault 35 is the [HHKB](https://hhkeyboard.us/blog/the-mystery-behind-the-ctrl-key-and-unique-hhkb-layout) layout. The first Vault 35 prototype that is similar to how it exists today was assembled sometime around September of 2021. In July of 2023, Cain posted a picture of his first functional prototype of a WKL Vault 35. This WKL Vault 35 was oddly enough in an aluminum case rather than the signature translucent cases that Vault 35s were nearly synonymous with. 

## Variants

One of the first non-Cain designed/produced Vault 35 case-compatible PCBs was the [Ortho Vault 35](https://github.com/galvy0/vault35_ortho) by galvy0.

Due to the popularity and crossover between 40% users and topre users, a 40% Keyboard Discord user named Calvin produced a Topre variant of the HHKB Vault 35 PCB and designated it as the "Travaulta".

Two other 40% users by the name of calvin-mcd and jlw_ took it upon theirselves to design and produce a series of Vault35 PCBs by the name of "[Pip Bois](/boards/pip-bois)". Layout options included HHKB Universal, HHKB Katana, WKL Katana, WKL Ortho soldered, WKL Ortho hotswap, and WKL Universal. 

This section is incomplete.

### Availability

Vault 35 kits are listed on Cain's site, https://mechvault.net/, when available. Vault35 kits or PCBs may also be found in the 40% Keyboard Discord server's buy-sell-trade forum or on Reddit's mechmarket. 

### Layout

Both variants of the Vault 35 designed by Cain support mutiple bottom rows, but have the same top 3 rows. In contrast to more standard "40s" the Vault 35 uses a 1.75u enter, which is generally not included in 3-key 40s compatbility kits.

Cain, while likely not the progenitor of them, did popularize a bottom row layout known as "Cain Bars", which consists of a series of keycaps in size order of 1.25u, 1.75u, 1.75u, 1.25u. Cain bars are *not* exclusive to Vault35 keyboards

# V4N4GON

The V4N4GON is a 45% board designed by Trashman.

### Overview

The V4N4GON, also refered to as V4N or Vanagon, is a 4.5u x 12.75u MiniVan-based keyboards sporting a half number-row primarily meant as a bridge between a 40% and 60% and as a MiniVan meant for gaming. The V4N4GON uses a JetVan layout bottom row. 

### Variants

There were three runs of V4N4GON, each with different cases types.



### Case Options

#### R1 V4N4GON
R1 V4N4GON is a 3-part, gasket mounted keyboard. The top and bottom parts of the case were made of machined aluminum while the middle portion was made of machined brass, clear coated to prevent it from patinaing. The case has sloped top portion and flat bottom portion with the text "V4N4GON" debossed into it in the upper right in the spot where the rest of the numbers would reside, had V4N4GON had a full numrow. 

#### R2 V4N4GON
R2 V4N4GON is minimally different from R1. It uses an aluminum midlayer rather than a brass one. 

#### R3 V4N4GON/Hullagon
R3 V4N4GON, or Hullagon as it was generally called, is a radically different case style compared to the previous runs. It instead was a hull-mounted, lower profile case, with a feature that resembled a carrying handle in the top right in the place of the V4N4GON text present on the early runs. The case also does not include the same type of LED cover as the previous runs, instead just having the plate act as the LED cover. 

#### Embrace
In favor of an R4 V4N4GON, a case and PCB designed by Hedgey404 was made. The case is a 2 part clear CNC machined acrylic

# Why use a 40% keyboard?

Work in progress, edits pending.

## Small, tailored, closer

People have different keyboard needs, but some common reasons for using a 40% board include:

- Small boards are easy to carry and need less desk space.
- Small is cool, cute or elegant, based on taste and needs.
- Good layers move many keys 'close', making small more efficient than large.

That small things fit in more places is obvious and includes backpacks and small desks. Even with a large desk, it is nice to free up some of the central area. Many people also prefer mechanical keys over rubberized dome keys, and using fewer of the (bulkier) mechanical keys helps with portability.

Tailoring for the needs at hand is elegant. If you normally type just letters, why carry around keys on the base layer for the numbers and the symbols? Expressing individuality is also a need, and smaller boards are easier and less expensive to customize than comparable larger ones. Some people like smaller boards with cool keycaps, cases and sound.

Good layering can make small boards more efficient than large unlayered ones. Layers let keys do multiple jobs based on the other keys that are also pressed, just like the normal shift key does. Using 'shifted' layers for more than just capital letters means many keyboard uses can be done efficiently with just the keys next to the fingers, including writing programs or novels. Using a large unlayered board means reaching further for keys that layers can put right under the fingers.

## Good layering

On a common laptop-sized keyboard, just under half of the keys require stretching or moving the hands followed by reorienting back to the home row, including distant yet common keys such as the arrow and delete keys. That reaching and reorienting is slow and can lead to hand issues.

Forty-percent keyboards reduce finger and hand stretch by moving some keys onto added layers right under the fingers. Full-size keyboards already do this by using the shift key for both capital letters and most of the symbols. Most people don't use huge keyboards with separate keys for the capital letters and extra symbols. Instead they use a shift key as a layer key. Forty-percent keyboards apply the same idea to a smaller set of base keys. They often use just the letter area plus side columns, and the keyboards often have just four rows.

A simple 40% keymap has two new layers and two new layer-shift keys. Holding one layer key accesses a layer with navigation, editing, numbers and functions; holding the other accesses a layer with symbols.

Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier than reaching for a distant key. Access can be by: pressing the layer-shift and base keys together, in sequence, or with other options. The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are on the base layer and how they access those on other layers. Common choices include: a number pad, richer navigation and editing on a dedicated layer, or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes.

Layering is a tradeoff between some cognitive complexity of accessing additional layers vs having more keys within closer reach. Either because that makes the keys more accessible or because only a few keys fit in some space. Where on that spectrum is best depends on the situation.

Once effective layering is used, similar full-size keyboards are unneeded bulk and expense.

## Size and type

Preferred board sizes vary, but four rows and 12 to 13 keys wide (12u-13u) is common. This is an easier size to start with, and many people find no reason to go smaller later. This size keeps the letters and outer columns (shift, delete, and return) on the base layer, with a bottom row of central thumb keys for space, layers and modifiers, and possible side utility keys for arrows or extras. It means the fingers never need to move far and allows a simple layering scheme. Narrower boards, such as ten keys wide, further reduce finger reach and size, but require more complex layering methods. Some of these techniques are described in [How](/how). 

Preferences also vary on how the physical keys are arranged: between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stagger and between unibody or split case bodies. Some are more familiar, while others are more common in full-size ergonomic boards.

Many small keyboard users are programmers, a group that is often typing or editing and cares about efficiency and hand ergonomics. There are times when a function or number row is very handy, such as for games or graphical tools that have heavy function and modifier use. But for general typing, including programming, it's often better to move the distant keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the distant keys.

In the end, small keyboards are a collection of choices and trade-offs about people's individual situation, typing, and hands.

## Example keymap

As a complete example, the Hillside's default keymap illustrates the simpler keymap techniques found among 40% keyboards.

- The letters and punctuation are on the base layer.
- Familiar side columns have shift, delete, return, etc.
- Arrow keys are on the base layer and/or a navigation layer.
- Thumb keys give easy access to a few additional layers.
- The added layers have
    - frequent navigation and editing keys on the home row of a nav/edit layer,
    - symbols, numbers, and function keys in familiar locations.

The keymap provides familiar elements for easier initial use but also more efficient layer-based alternatives that can be grown into. The [KeymapDB](https://keymapdb.com/) has additional keymap examples for different board size, shape, preferences and needs. Some additional layering techniques used with much smaller boards are described in [How](/how).

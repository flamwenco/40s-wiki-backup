# New User's Guide
If you're looking to build your first 40% three easily accessible options are provided, each with a slightly different approach to a 40% keyboard. 

## Minivan
Minivan is a common recommendation to those looking to get a 40%. It takes away several dedicated keys that will need to be implemented otherwise if the user wants to type them, but retains a similar shape and layout to that of a 60% keyboard. 

The most commonly offered layout for minivan is minisub, which allows for  either a 6.25u space bar or 2.75-2.25-1.25u bars in the same space along the bottom.

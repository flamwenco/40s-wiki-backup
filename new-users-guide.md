# New Users' Guide
If you're looking to build your first 40%, three easily accessible options are provided below, each with a slightly different approach to a 40% keyboard. 

## Minivan
Minivan is a common recommendation to those looking to get a 40%. It takes away several dedicated keys that will need to be implemented otherwise if the user wants to type them, but retains a similar shape and layout to that of a 60% keyboard. 

The most commonly offered layout for minivan is minisub, which allows for  either a 6.25u space bar or 2.75-2.25-1.25u bars in the same space along the bottom.

Minivan and related PCBs can be purchased from the following locations:

There are also numerous open source, 3D printable cases available for minivan PCBs

## Le Chiffre
Le Chiffre is a classic mix between a split board and a unibody board. It has a bit steeper of a learning curve than a Minivan, but it has the benefit of being more ergonomic and being more distinct from a rectangular row stagger board.

# 40s Day

40s Day is on the 40th day of the year (February 9th). People in the 40% percent community celebrate 40s day by both spamming pictures of their keyboards in the #pictures channel of the [40% Discord Server](https://discord.gg/40percent) and [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/). 40% community members also generally take this day as an opportunity to explain how they actually use their 40% keyboards to people who assume they are just novelties (also see [How page](how)). 

40s Day is unfortunately still met with much pushback on r/MechanicalKeyboards despite having gone on for several years at this point. 

Some times after 40s Day, an album of the keyboards posted on 40s Day will be arranged for that year's collection.
